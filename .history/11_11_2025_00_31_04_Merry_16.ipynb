    "In this project, I will conduct a complete data science workflow to explore and predict player behavior on a video game research server. The dataset comes from a real-world study conducted by a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, which investigates how people play and interact within a Minecraft environment. The data records how players navigate the server, complete tasks, and engage in different in-game activities. Understanding this dataset is important because the research team must allocate appropriate resources to support ongoing experiments.\n",
