    "The majority of players are between 15 and 30 years old. There are fewer older players, and their playing times also tend to be relatively low. A few subscribed players, particularly under age 25, play dramatically more hours (above 100), indicating highly engaged users. Both subscribed and non-subscribed players appear across all age groups. However, the high-hour outliers mostly belong to the subscribed group, suggesting that subscription may be associated with greater playtime. In general, this visualization supports that played_hours is positively associated with subscription, particularly among younger players, and gives initial, descriptive evidence for my question."

    "To examine whether played_hours can predict newsletter subscription, I plan to use a kknn classification model. This method is appropriate because the outcome variable, subscribe, is binary, and kknn is a flexible classifier that does not assume linear relationships or specific distributions. It classifies users based on the behaviour of nearby players, which fits well with the idea that players with similar gameplay patterns may have similar subscription tendencies. Before modelling, I will clean the data, remove NA values, and standardize numeric predictors. I will split the data into 70% training and 30% testing, and then use 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to choose the best value of k. Model performance will be assessed using accuracy and confusion matrices, and the final selected model will be evaluated on the test set. Potential limitations include the sensitivity of kknn model to outliers, class imbalance, and the choice of k. "

    "To further address whether younger players tend to have longer played_hours, I will use ggplot visualizations rather than a predictive model. This question is descriptive in nature, and visualization is well-suited for exploring trends in game time across ages. I will create plots such as boxplots comparing played_hours across age groups or histograms showing the general trend of played_hours across age. These visualizations will help reveal general patterns, though they cannot establish causation and may be affected by skewed data or uneven group sizes. By combining kknn classification for the predictive question and ggplot visual exploration for age-related patterns, this plan provides a structured and appropriate approach to addressing both parts of the question.
