    "In this project, I will conduct a complete data science workflow to explore and predict player behavior on a video game research server. The dataset comes from a real-world study conducted by a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, which investigates how people play and interact within a Minecraft environment. The data records how players navigate the server, complete tasks, and engage in different in-game activities. Understanding this dataset is important because the research team must allocate appropriate resources to support ongoing experiments.\n",

    "This project will involve data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. By examining patterns and relationships within the dataset, I will work toward formulating and answering a predictive question about the data related to a video game research server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I will conduct a preliminary analysis, organization and visualization of the dataset to make it ready for further operation and manipulation. The report will have three major parts: I will first state one broad question that I will address, and the specific question that I have formulated; Then I will analyze and visualize the data; In the end, I will discuss what methods I will use in further analysis and how I plan to conduct the analysis.

If we want to do time calculations, we need to convert them into date/datetime first. An alternative way is to convert the original_start_time and original_end_time.
